== Description

It's a jenkins plugin that collects via API job and test results and reports them :

* in a single html view,
* email
* graphs

[TIP]
==== 
It's advisable to be used as the last step in a CI/CD pipeline. Currently supports only 'free style project' but can be integrated in a groovy pipeline script just by using a build action , for example : 

    stage("Aggregate Report") {	
      build job: 'My_aggregate_results_job'
    }
